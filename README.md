# PORTFOLIO

Hi! My name is Natalia Tront. I'm 33 years old Polish woman and I want to change my career path to software tester.

For few years I was working as office assistant. An employment brake allowed me to realize that it isn't a job I want to do in the futere. So I start searching.
When I found information about software tasting something "click" on my mind :) I remembered how I loved proofreading, searching mistakes and inaccuracy when I was younger an how I gave up to do it proffesional because of non-future proffesion and low salary.

Reading about software testing, I think it is a job which can combine my passion of finding bugs and my job expectiations.

I start learning and I have hope to find my dream job. Here you can see my way becoming software tester.

## Little more about me
I'm a person with lot of different skills, knowledge and interests. I'm a Master of Education in Polish Philology but also Technician of Business Administration with Finance and Accounting specialization. Since teenage years I was writting my own fiction, after few hard review I realize that first I must learn how to write. Than I discover proofreading and it became my hobby for many years. It improved my `perception` to finding mistakes and `logical thinking`.

When I was a student I got a job as office assistant. The most importnat thing I was doing there was prepering tender offers. That teach me `accuracy`, `keeping deadlines` and `writting official documents` - skills which I think they are very important on testing.

After few years I became a mom and start an employment brake. But it wasn't lazy time! I start my own litte "business" - sewing wool diapers as [Hearties](https://www.facebook.com/Hearties/). I needed to learn everything about production, Internet selling and contact with clients. It required me to `prioritize`, `self-denial` and `responsibility`.

I decide to return a full time job but it didn't take long time because I had health problems and needed an operation. That's the moment when I start thinking about change my proffesion. I'm healthy now ;)

I think that my past experience gave me strong soft skills to doing software testing.
