# PORTFOLIO

Hi! My name is Natalia Tront. I'm 33 years old Polish woman and I want to change my career path to software tester.
For few years I was working as office assistant. An employment brake allowed me to realize that it isn't a job I want to do in the futere. So I start searching.
When I found information about software tasting something "click" on my mind :) I remembered how I loved proofreading, searching mistakes and inaccuracy when I was younger an how I gave up to do it proffesional because of non-future proffesion and low salary.
Reading about software testing, I think it is a job which can combine my passion of finding bugs and my job expectiations.

I start learning and I have hope to find my dream job. Here you can see my way becoming software tester.
